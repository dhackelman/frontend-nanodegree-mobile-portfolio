## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

This project was all about the need for SPEED. I started by learning how to use ngrok to host the pages so that I could test PageSpeed. This was not an easy task, but I perservered and got it going. Command line is getting easier to work with. 

###Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

1. Started by reading and re-reading (http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

2. After installing/running grunt, I created the necessary package.json and Gruntfile.js files. The next step was to use ngrok to test my PageSpeeds. Using my command line I hosted index.html on my local server. I then initiated ngrok through the command line which allowed me to test index.html on pagespeeds with a forwarding port address.

3. My first PageSpeeds read-out had the following suggestions: 

	1) Optimize images: this was the largest time/speed suck for my site. It recommended that I re-size or somehow optimize my images to speed delivery of the webpage. This made sense since we were dealing with multiple image files (both jpg and png). 
		Thanks to these sites for the help:

			(https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/blob/master/docs/uglify-examples.md)

	2) PageSpeeds said I should Part of the tutorial also had me "uglify" my js and minify HTML and css. That helped speed things up as well.

4. After more testing, tweaking, and moderate tantruming, my 


####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
